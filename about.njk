I have some neat <a href="https://github.com/edelstone">open-source projects on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>Media I consume</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Music:</strong> I try to listen to new music every day. Favorite genres include post-rock (Dirty Three, Mogwai), instrumental ambient (&Oacute;lafur Arnalds, Nils Frahm), and slowcore (Low, Bedhead). <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/tsanzer">My listening stats are on Last.fm</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Books:</strong> I read the occasional fiction classic, but otherwise I&#8217;m mostly into non-fiction, particularly on the subjects of space science, philosophy, and American history.</li>
      <li><strong>Podcasts:</strong> I usually listen to a couple podcasts each day. Lately I&#8217;m enjoying Unherd, Fleccas Talks, and The Brendan O&#8217;Neill Show.</li>
      <li><strong>Film:</strong> I watch <em>a lot</em> of movies. Big fan of &#8217;80s cinema, over-the-top action flicks, and South Korean films.</li>
      <li><strong>TV:</strong> My favorite shows of all time include Slings &amp; Arrows, Home Movies, The IT Crowd, Community, and The League of Gentlemen.</li>
      <li><strong>Social:</strong> I try to avoid it, because it&#8217;s terrible.</li>
    </ul>
