    <p><a href="https://balto.ai">Balto</a> builds AI-driven listening software for large call centers. Prior to this project, their core product&mdash;<em>Real-Time Guidance</em>&mdash;was a desktop application that delivered automated suggestions and encouragement during live customer calls. While effective, it was narrow in scope and constrained future growth.</p>
    <p>Building on Balto&rsquo;s machine learning foundation, I conceived and validated multiple user flows that resulted in a new product offering, <em>Real-Time Coaching</em>. The module introduced a native chat experience and data-visualization tools giving managers an at-a-glance view of team activity and productivity.</p>
