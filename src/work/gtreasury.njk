    <p><a href="https://gtreasury.com">GTreasury</a> builds treasury management software for governments and large institutions. Its primary application dates back to the early days of the web and had become fragmented and inconsistent over time.</p>
    <p>I led a ground-up redesign and content strategy, delivering structured, component-based artifacts designed to endure as teams transitioned to a modern JavaScript framework. The resulting design system—nicknamed <em>Obelisk</em>—was immediately used to prototype high-priority user flows and prove its value.</p>
    <p>Partnering with a front-end engineer, I wrote the CSS for a <a href="https://gtreasury.netlify.app">pixel-perfect coded prototype</a> that brought the system to life.</p>
