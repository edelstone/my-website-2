    <p><a href="https://kuali.co">Kuali</a> is a well-known pioneer of software products for higher education academics, professionals, and students. I was the primary designer for the Research product, where I interviewed users, designed and tested prototypes, and often coded my own designs to take pressure off the engineers.</p>
    <p>Multiple product lines, each with their own dedicated sales and development teams, led to numerous UIs with few systems to sync around central goals. In response, I incrementally developed a dynamic, unifying structure for all products to strive towards including common navigation, search functionality, and co-branding.</p>
